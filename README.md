&nbsp;
## 01 Add the Band component

* Create *Band.js*, import and display it in *App*.


&nbsp;
## 02 Pass props

* Pass the band name and members as props from App to Band.

&nbsp;
## 03 More props

* Pass image and story.


&nbsp;
## 04 Style

* Edit the card style and add the 'Lato' font.


&nbsp;
## 05 MemberList and Default Props

* Move members to a separate component and use defaultProps.



&nbsp;
## 06 Navbar

* Add a Navbar component.



&nbsp;
## 07 BandList

* Add a BandList component and render it in App. Add more bands via defaultProps.




&nbsp;
## 08 State

* Add the constructor and copy the initial state bands data from the defaultProps. Now the sample data is passed to BandList as props from the initial state.


&nbsp;
## 09 IDs

* Add an id property to each band and use it as key in the map function instead of the array index which may be changing, for example when we delete a band.
Also add the nextBandId state component.



&nbsp;
## 10 BandForm

* Add the BandForm component. It contains a close button, an input for the name,an input for the image url, mapped inputs for the members, a button for adding members, a textarea for the story and the submit button.

* Configure the general handleChange event, instead of configuring multiple handlers for various inputs, using event.target.name as key.


&nbsp;
## 11 Member handlers

* Configure handleNewMember and handleMemberChange.



&nbsp;
## 12 handleSubmit

* The App passes a callback function to the BandForm as a prop. This callback will update the state in App. On submit the form simply will call this callback (onSave) and a copy of all the values in the form's state will be passed to it.

* handleSubmit also clears the form data.



&nbsp;
## 13 handleSave

* Configure the save handler that is passed to the BandForm as the onSave prop's value. Adds the new band to the bands array and increases the nextBandId by one.


&nbsp;
## 14 Show and hide BandForm

* Set the showForm piece of state in App and render the BandForm conditionally.
* Pass callbacks to the Navbar (onNewBand) and to the BandForm (onClose).
* Update showForm to false in handleSave so that the form closes on save.


&nbsp;
## 15 Delete Bands

* Pass the onDelete method prop from App to Band through BandList.
* Call it as a callback on button click with the id prop so that the id of the band to be deleted becomes available to removeBand.
